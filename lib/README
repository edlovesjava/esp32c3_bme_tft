This directory is intended for project-specific (private) libraries.

PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder will look automatically for libraries
in this folder, so you can place your custom libraries here.

The source code of each library should be placed in a separate directory
with its own `library.json` manifest file.

Example:
```
|--lib
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--library.json
|  |  |--src
|  |     |--Bar.c
|  |     |--Bar.h
|  |--Foo
|  |  |--library.json
|  |  |--src
|  |     |--Foo.c
|  |     |--Foo.h
|--src
   |--main.cpp
```
